## 3D Printed Enclosure

The enclosure can be 3D printed, but should be printed using PETG or some other UV-Resistant material. PLA will degrade quickly in the sun. Additionally, it should be a light color such as white to avoid passive solar radiation absorption which will interfere with the temperature and humidity readings. We use the [Duramic 3D Silk White](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TRPQ4MN) filament.

If you're printing the enclosure yourself, you'll also need a [soldering iron](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B3SG6UQ) and [heat-set insert tips](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B17VQLD) to install the heat-set inserts.

All of the enclosure files can be found in the [/Industrial_Design folder](/Industrial_Design/Enclosure/).

## Clima.Pro PCB

The Clima.Pro PCB was created in EasyEDA, and the source files as well as component BoM can be found on [OSHW Lab](https://oshwlab.com/bryan_6020/wilderness-labs-clima).
